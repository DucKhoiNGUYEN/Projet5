There are 4 different algorithms to analyze the 5 graphs. The 2 LR graphs are relatively small compared to the other 3, which are real-life examples.
There are 2 ways to read the graphs: either by using the nx library function (in randomWalks and Newman) or by using the other function by Arsen (Louvain). 
Label propagation is the fastest per se.
